1) You need the following packages for installing this sw:

- libtool
- freeglut3-dev
- libglew-dev

the following command would do in on an Ubuntu system:

% sudo apt-get install libtool freeglut3-dev libglew-dev

2) clean the project

% make distclean
% make clean

3) build and execute

% make
% ./browser

4) Sometimes you have to uncomment this line in Browser/browser.c (around line
   446):

  // Uncomment following line if you have problems initiating GLEW
  //
-  // glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
+  glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;

5) Sometimes you have to remove GL library from Makefile:

-LIBS = -lm -lglut -lGLU -lGL -ljpeg -lGLEW
+LIBS = -lm -lglut -lGLU -ljpeg -lGLEW
